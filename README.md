## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To set up and use a Node.js compiler, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### 1. Node.js

Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download the latest version from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Code Editor

Choose a code editor for writing your Node.js applications. Popular choices include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### 3. Terminal or Command Prompt

Have a terminal or command prompt installed on your system. This is used to run Node.js scripts and commands.

### 4. Text Editor

A basic text editor is needed for creating and editing JavaScript files. You can use any text editor of your choice, including Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or any other preferred editor.

### 5. Internet Connection

Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as Node.js may need to download packages and dependencies during project setup.

### 6. Understanding of JavaScript

A basic understanding of JavaScript is essential, as Node.js is built on JavaScript. Familiarize yourself with JavaScript syntax, concepts, and common practices.

### 7. Package.json File

Create a `package.json` file for your Node.js project. This file includes metadata about the project and its dependencies. You can create it manually or use the `npm init` command to generate it interactively.

### Installation of Specific Packages (Optional)

Depending on your project requirements, you may need additional npm packages or libraries. Install them using the `npm install` command.

With these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to write, compile, and run Node.js applications.
